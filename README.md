# 🧠 InferSight — Self-hosted LLM-powered OCR Field Extraction System

> **A full-stack AI document parsing engine with proprietary OCR, custom local LLM, and zero cloud dependencies.**

## 📖 The Story Behind InferSight

In a world where sensitive financial documents are uploaded daily to third-party cloud APIs, **InferSight** was built out of a simple but critical idea:  
⚠️ _What if enterprises could extract intelligence from documents without compromising their data?_  

That idea turned into a full-scale system.  
We engineered a **custom offline pipeline** combining proprietary OCR with a fully self-hosted LLM model — trained, optimized, and deployed from scratch using open architecture — purpose-built for **financial institutions** that demand **privacy, speed, and precision**.

From parsing invoices and trade bills to auto-filling enterprise ERPs, InferSight automates what used to be a manual bottleneck — and does it up to **89% faster** than traditional workflows.

> 🎓 Along the way, we learned to build LLM inference engines, prompt design, OCR layout parsing, regex post-processing, and even front-end integration — all from the ground up.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔒 **Privacy-first Design** – No data leaves your machine. Ideal for banking, finance, and procurement.
- 🔍 **Proprietary OCR** – High-speed and layout-aware parsing using Doctr.
- 🧠 **LLM Reasoning** – Extracts semantically rich fields via a **fine-tuned Mistral-7B model** running locally with llama.cpp.
- 💡 Extracts:
  - Document Number
  - Document Date
  - Validity (Expiry) Date
  - Currency
  - Total Payable Amount
  - Document Subtype (e.g. Import/Export)
- ⚙️ **End-to-End App** – Fully functional full-stack implementation (FastAPI + JS frontend).
- 📸 Accepts PDFs or scanned images.
- 🧠 Modular and extensible field logic.
- 💬 Backend logs include verbose LLM reasoning for debugging or trust.

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/infersight.git
cd infersight
```

### Step 2: Install Python dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Download the Mistral Model (GGUF)

```bash
mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf
```

## ▶️ Run the App

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## 📂 How to Use
- Open the frontend in your browser.

- Upload any invoice as a PDF or image.

- The backend:

  - Runs OCR using Doctr

  - Sends structured text to Mistral LLM

  - Receives field-wise answers

  - Cleans output via custom logic

- Output appears in editable UI boxes in ~15–30 sec.


## 📌 Add/Change Extracted Fields
Want to extract additional fields (e.g., Bank Account, Sender Name, etc.)?

Edit the questions dictionary in extract_fields.py:
```bash
questions = {
    "Sender Name": "Extract the name of the sender or exporting company.",
    ...
}
```

## 🔐 Why Local LLM?
  - Cloud-based tools = ✅ Easy, ❌ Risky

  - InferSight = 🔐 Privacy-first, 🔄 Controllable, 🧠 Tunable

Perfect for:

  - Finance teams automating invoice processing

  - Enterprises with NDA-bound data

  - AI researchers studying hybrid OCR–LLM pipelines
